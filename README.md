Hi, I’m Omkar.

I’m a computer science student who enjoys building things that solve real problems.  
What interests me most about engineering is the process — taking an idea, breaking it down, understanding the tradeoffs, and turning it into something reliable and useful.

Over the last few years, I’ve worked on projects that pushed me beyond coursework and forced me to think about real users, real constraints, and real failure cases. One such project was "AarogyaLekha", a centralized digital health record system designed to replace fragmented and unreliable physical medical files. Building it helped me understand how impactful software can be when it’s designed around an actual need rather than just a feature list.

My current focus is on strengthening my foundations in:
- Backend systems
- Database concepts and internals
- Core computer science fundamentals (DBMS, OS, DSA)

I prefer building fewer projects with more depth — projects where I can clearly explain design decisions, performance considerations, and limitations.

Recently, alongside software development, I’ve also started exploring electronics and low-level concepts, and I’m enjoying learning how software and hardware intersect.

This GitHub is a record of projects I’m actively working on or have built with the intent to fully understand and defend them in technical discussions.
